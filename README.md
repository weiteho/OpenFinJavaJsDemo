# OpenFin Java and JavaScript Applications communication using IAB and Channel API. 

### What does this demo do?

1. The Java Application (JavaApp) starts the OpenFin JavaScript Application (JsApp) if it's not already running.
2. The JavaApp is a ChannelProvider, which responds to "GetJavaTime" and "KillJavaApp" actions.
3. The JsApp is a ChannelClient, which dispatches actions "GetJavaTime" to get "currentTimeMillis" and "KillJavaApp" to terminate the JavaApp.

### How does JavaApp know if the JsApp is running?

By using OpenFin Java Adapter API [Application.isRunning()](https://github.com/weiteho/OpenFinJavaJsDemo/blob/main/src/main/java/com/openfin/demo/OpenFinJavaJsChannelDemo.java#L122)

### How does JsApp know if the JavaApp is ready?

By connecting to the Channel [without waiting](https://github.com/weiteho/OpenFinJavaJsDemo/blob/main/OpenFinJs/my-app.html#L37), if it fails, then the JavaApp is not ready. If the JavaApp is not ready, then it [listens to the specified IAB topic "JavaAppReady"](https://github.com/weiteho/OpenFinJavaJsDemo/blob/main/OpenFinJs/my-app.html#L31), which the JavaApp will publish a message to [when it's ready](https://github.com/weiteho/OpenFinJavaJsDemo/blob/main/src/main/java/com/openfin/demo/OpenFinJavaJsChannelDemo.java#L109).
